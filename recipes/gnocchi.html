        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Gnocchi are a type of miniature pasta dumplings, usually made from wheat, eggs, potatoes. 
            With a lightly dense texture and potato flavor, they are a hearty and unique type of pasta. 
            Gnocchi have been a traditional type of pasta in Italy since Roman times, though they are said 
            to have originated in the Middle East.
